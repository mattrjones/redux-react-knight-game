# redux-react-knight-game

This a React application with a Rails API backend that uses Redux to manage its state. The knight game is an educational game for young children that lets them take their custom-made characters on adventures through the world of Ashdale by answering simple questions in order to complete mythical quests.

## Getting Started

To get started, fork and clone this repository into your local environment. Navigate into the backend folder, and run 'rake db:migrate' and 'rake db:seed' to populate the database with the questions that you or your child will need to answer on their noble quests. Then, run 'rails s' to start the server. Once that's done, it's time to move to the frontend folder. There, all you'll have to do is run 'npm start' to launch the application and you'll be ready to explore the wonderful world of Ashdale!
